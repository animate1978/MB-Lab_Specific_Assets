# MB-Lab_Specific_Assets
This repository is intended to spur development of character assets specifically geared to work well with MB-Lab.

The original MHC MC vs MB-Lab assets.zip file contains a Blender v2.80beta blend file created with MB-Lab v1.70 with an average human female body asset, and MakeHumanCommunity (MHC) MakeClothes (MC) assets for body, dress, hair, skirt, and tights.

It also includes basic variations of the human female hair asset that comes with MB-Lab v1.70.

The initial goal is to create analogous assets for the MHC MC dress, hair, skirt, and tights that will properly fight a wide range of MB-Lab assets, eventually including assets for each class of available MB-Lab character asset.

Thank you.
